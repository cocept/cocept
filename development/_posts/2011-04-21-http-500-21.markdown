<p>This post shows you how to fix the following IIS error message: <strong>Handler &quot;PageHandlerFactory-Integrated&quot; has a bad module &quot;ManagedPipelineHandler&quot; in its module list</strong> This error occurs when the IIS module is incorrectly registered (nope, I don&#39;t know what that means either.) But to fix it, follow the steps below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First open explorer by holding the windows key and pressing E</li>
	<li>Then open the drive that Windows is installed on (Most likely C:)</li>
	<li>Navigate to &quot;C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\&quot;</li>
	<li>If you have a 64 bit computer, open the folder &quot;Framework64&quot;, otherwise &quot;Framework32&quot;</li>
	<li>Now open the folder named with the highest version of ASP.NET you have installed (most likely something like &quot;v4.0.30319&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now you have found this folder, you need to navigate to it in command prompt with administrator permissions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Click &quot;Start&quot;</li>
	<li>Type &quot;cmd&quot;</li>
	<li>Right click it and click &quot;Run as administrator&quot; then accept the user account control popup</li>
	<li>In command prompt, navigate to the folder we navigated to earlier. Do this by typing &quot;cd&quot; followed by a space, and the path
	<ul>
		<li>e.g. &quot;cd windows\Microsoft.net\...&quot; etc</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Now when in the correct folder, type &quot;aspnet_regiis.exe -i&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>You should see a success message and IIS will work.</p>
