Beach hopping, swimming and dining out around the beautiful Spanish island of Ibiza, all while avoiding the tumult
of inebriated and sun burnt fellow visitors. We discovered Ibiza's hippy region which plays host to a plethora
of glistening beaches in hidden coves, shimmering, clear water and small and authentic restaurents offering
various local delicacies.
