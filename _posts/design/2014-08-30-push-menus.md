## Push Menu

A Push Menu is a navigational menu that is placed off canvas and brought into view when the user performs a particular action. 

Checkout [this example of a push menu](http://jasny.github.io/bootstrap/examples/navmenu-push/) by clicking the menu icon at the top left of the page. Watch as the menu slides into view and pushes the rest of the screen away at the same time.

Let's explore some of the reasons Push Menu's can be effective on the web.

## Pros

### Great at Handling Complexity

To help the users effectively navigate a website, the navigation options are typically **categorised and sorted into a hierarchical structure**.

As Push Menus are given the luxury of taking up the entire screen when they are visible, there is no **need to compromise on the amount of content** presented as long as it's format has been well designed.

Lots of push menus therefore provide comprehensive navigation options and **maintain the concept of a hierarchy** using spacing, typography, colouring and various other design techniques.

### Screen Real Estate

On the higher screen sizes drop down menus lend themselves very well to the problem of displaying hierarchical navigation without consuming too much space. 

However drop down menus are very difficult to adapt to screens that are small or touch sensitive.

As Push Menus are only visible when they are needed, they provide another way that you can maintain that hierarchical nav structure while still being lean with screen real estate for your more important content. 

### Follows Convention

The Push Menu UX pattern has been pioneered by big names like Facebook and Google. The hamburger icon as seen below has become a universal symbol to represent a menu, despite breaking the UX Designer's rule of Visibility (More on that later):

Users are now comfortable with using Push Menus to get around, and this affords designers much more freedom when designing navigation.

> Great at handling hierarchical and complex navigation structures, and can save you some valuable screen real estate

## Cons

### Visibility

As mentioned above, the Push Menu breaks the UX Designer's [number 1 rule of visibility](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)!

In order to be effective, all functionality on a page should be visible to the user. This is not the case with a menu that is off screen, and an icon that could be misconstrued for a tasty snack.

Fortunately the benefits of the Push Menu has outweighted it's negatives so heavily that it has become a staple part of the diet of the every day web user.

### Platform Compatability

Certain older browsers and devices might have difficulty displaying a Push Menu, depending on the way it has been developed.

Most rely on CSS3 transformations meaning that the menu won't work on older browsers. Some rely on javascript, meaning that browser's with javascript disabled will have a significant experience disadvantage.

### Slower Usage

One main disadvantage is the need for the user to click twice in order to navigate - once to open the Push Menu, and a second time to click the link they want. 

This slows down your users, which is bad considering most users want to get in and out of your site quicker than you can say McDonald's.

> Breaks the rule of Visibility, can be difficult to implement across platforms, and slows down navigation speed

## Conclusion

So, Push Menus are great when you have a **complex and hierarchical navigation structure**. 

But they should only really be used on screens that are **small or touch screen** because they slow down the browsing experience and would take our visitors by surprise if used on dekstop sized screens.
