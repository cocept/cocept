excerpt: Twitter has discontinued their tweet API which means this post is now deprecated

<p><span style="color: red">Twitter has discontinued their tweet API which means that all third party plugins no longer work. Currently, the only way to get tweets on your web page without using some server side code like PHP, is to use the official twitter widget.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Go to the link below and login to your account</li>
</ul>

<p>https://twitter.com/settings/widgets</p>

<ul>
	<li>From here you can configure your widget parameters, grab the code and inject it into your site</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&#39;s all there is to it!&nbsp;</p>
