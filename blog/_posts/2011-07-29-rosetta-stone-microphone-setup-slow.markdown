<p>If, when starting up Rosetta Stone, the microphone configuration stage where you have to repeat &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; takes longer than a few steps (On average I was repeating them 13 times! Now down to 1.), here is what you can do to fix it:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the bottom right hand side of your screen,<strong> right &nbsp;click the speaker icon</strong> and click &quot;<strong>Recording devices</strong>&quot;</li>
	<li>Find your microphone (usually the one with a big green tick on the picture) and left click it</li>
	<li>Now click the &quot;<strong>Configure</strong>&quot; button at the bottom left of the window</li>
	<li>Choose &quot;<strong>Setup Microphone</strong>&quot;</li>
	<li>Check the appropriate radio box according to your type of microphone and click &quot;Next&quot; twice</li>
	<li>Now read the sentence in bold. On Windows 7 it is, &quot;Peter dictates to his computer. He prefers it to typing, and particularly prefers it to pen and paper&quot;.</li>
	<li>Click &quot;Next&quot; and finish the wizard.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps configure the volume level of your microphone. It significantly increased mine, meaning Rosetta Stone could hear me more clearly and I would not have to keep repeating the &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; step.</p>
