<p>Some people have been complaining of their HTC Android phone playing the <strong>camera</strong> <strong>shutter</strong> <strong>sound</strong> randomly. Most people do not realise that this is caused by a <strong>software update</strong> that allows their phone to take<strong> screen shots </strong>of the current screen!</p>

<p>Step 1)<strong> Hold &quot;Power&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Step 2)<strong> Press</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&quot;Home&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Step 3) <strong>Release &quot;Power&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Screen shots are saved into your <strong>Gallery</strong> with the rest of your camera photos:</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="7" src="/images/development/htc-screenshots.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>This seems to be a feature included with android 2.3.5 for HTC. It may or may not work with your phone! Tried and tested with an HTC Desire HD. Feel free to drop me a comment with any reports of this technique working with other devices :)</p>
